Neural Network MATLAB simulation for ‘Understanding how to solve pattern recognition problems using backpropagation’

This is an assignment I conducted during my Data Science MSc. The whole report was conducted on MATLAB.

This project includes the analysis and findings of a pattern recognition neural network problem using
backpropagation. The aim is to build a model that can predict whether a cancer patient’s condition is
‘benign’ or ‘malignant’. There are 699 instances each with a value of 1-10 over a series of 9 variables
and a value of 1 or 0 for an output which determines whether a cancer patients’ condition is or isn’t
malignant respectively. This report explores the benefit of finding the optimal value of epochs and
nodes, the benefit or detriment of using ensembled methods for classifiers and the comparison of 3
different training optimisers
